            *1. State Transition Testing*
- *Definition:*  
  A technique that tests the system’s behavior as it moves from one state to another based on events or inputs.
 *Focus:*  
  Changes in system *states* (e.g., login → dashboard → logout).
 *Used When:*  
  The system behavior depends on *past actions or sequences* (like ATM, vending machines, login systems).

 *Example:*  
  User enters wrong password 3 times → account gets locked.

2. Use Case Testing*
*Definition:*  
  A technique that tests *user interactions* with the system based on real-life *scenarios* or *flows*.
 *Focus:*  
  How the system responds to *user actions* to achieve a goal.
 *Used When:*  
Testing *end-to-end flows* and user behavior (like online shopping, booking tickets).

*Example:*  
  User searches product → adds to cart → completes payment.

*Key Difference:*  
- *State Transition Testing* checks system *state changes*.  
- *Use Case Testing* validates *user goal-based workflows*.

                      State Transition Testing:
State transition testing is a black-box software testing technique that focuses on verifying the behavior of a system as it transitions between different states in response to specific events or inputs. This technique is particularly useful for systems where the output depends not only on the current input but also on the system's previous state.

Core Concepts:
State: A distinct condition or mode the system can be in at a given moment. For example, in a banking application, states could include "Logged Out," "Logged In," "Funds Available," or "Account Locked."
Event: An input or action that triggers a change from one state to another. Examples include "entering credentials," "making a deposit," or "exceeding login attempts."
Transition: The movement of the system from one state to another, initiated by an event.
Action: The system's response or output that occurs during or after a state transition. This could be displaying a success message, denying access, or performing a calculation.

State transition testing involves:
Modeling the System: Representing the system's states and transitions using a state transition diagram (a visual representation) or a state transition table (a tabular representation). These models define all possible states, the events that cause transitions between them, and the resulting actions.
Designing Test Cases: Creating test cases to cover all valid and invalid state transitions. This includes:
Valid Transitions: Testing that the system correctly moves to the expected next state when a valid event occurs.
Invalid Transitions: Testing that the system handles unexpected or incorrect events gracefully, preventing unauthorized transitions or displaying appropriate error messages.
Sequence Testing: Testing sequences of events and transitions to ensure the system behaves as expected over a series of interactions.
Executing Tests: Executing the designed test cases and observing the system's behavior to confirm that it transitions between states correctly and performs the right actions during these transitions.
example:
State ID   Description        
 S1        User not logged in 
 S2        User logged in     
 S3        Item added to cart 
 S4        Order placed 

 Event ID  Input / Action   
 E1        Login            
 E2        Add item to cart 
 E3        Place order      
 E4        Logout           
   
   The user starts in S1 (Not Logged In).
   After login (E1), they go to S2 (Logged In).
   They can add an item (E2) → moves to S3 (Item Added to Cart).
   When they place the order (E3), they reach S4 (Order Placed).
   Logout (E4) always takes them back to S1 (Not Logged In)
