 3 examples explaining White Box Testing :

1. Condition/Decision Testing:  
Example: In a login system, if the condition is:  
if username == "admin" and password == "1234":  
White box testing checks all possible paths, like:  
--> Correct username & password  
--> Correct username, wrong password  
--> Wrong username, correct password  
--> Both wrong

2. Loop Testing:  
Example: In a function that runs:  
for i in range(5):  
White box testing checks:  
--> What happens if the loop runs 0 times  
--> Exactly 5 times  
--> More than 5 times (if modified)

3. Statement Testing:  
Example:  
python
if x > 0:  
   print("Positive")  
else:  
   print("Negative or Zero")

White box testing ensures both statements are executed by giving inputs like x = 5 and x = -2.

2.Summarize key challenge and solutions related to White Box Testing.
1. Requires Code Knowledge  
==> Testers need to understand programming and logic.  
==>  Involve developers or provide training for testers in basic coding and logic flow.
2.  Time-Consuming  
==>  Covering all code paths, loops, and conditions takes time.  
==>  Use automation tools and focus on critical paths first.
3. Maintenance Overhead  
==>  When code changes, tests need updating.  
==> Keep test cases modular and well-documented for easy updates.
4.Limited to Internal Logic  
==>  Doesn't cover missing requirements or real-world usage.  
==>  Combine with black box testing for complete coverage.
