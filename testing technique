            State transition testing
-> It is a black-box software testing technique that focuses on verifying the behavior of a system as it transitions between
different states in response to specific events or inputs. This technique is particularly useful for systems where the output
depends not only on the current input but also on the system's previous state.

                  Use case testing 
Use case testing is a black-box testing technique that validates a system's functional
creating test cases based on use cases, which describe how a user ("actor") interacts with the system 
to achieve a specific goal. It focuses on end-to-end transactions, covering both the main success scenario
and potential extensions, or error conditions, to identify gaps that might be missed in component testing.

                      State Transition Testing:
State transition testing is a black-box software testing technique that focuses on verifying the behavior of a system as it transitions between different states in response to specific events or inputs. This technique is particularly useful for systems where the output depends not only on the current input but also on the system's previous state.

Core Concepts:
State: A distinct condition or mode the system can be in at a given moment. For example, in a banking application, states could include "Logged Out," "Logged In," "Funds Available," or "Account Locked."
Event: An input or action that triggers a change from one state to another. Examples include "entering credentials," "making a deposit," or "exceeding login attempts."
Transition: The movement of the system from one state to another, initiated by an event.
Action: The system's response or output that occurs during or after a state transition. This could be displaying a success message, denying access, or performing a calculation.

State transition testing involves:
Modeling the System:
Designing Test Cases:
Valid Transitions: 
Invalid Transitions: 
Sequence Testing: 
Executing Tests: 
ex:
State ID   Description        
 S1        User not logged in 
 S2        User logged in     
 S3        Item added to cart 
 S4        Order placed 

 Event ID  Input / Action   
 E1        Login            
 E2        Add item to cart 
 E3        Place order      
 E4        Logout           
   
   The user starts in S1 (Not Logged In).
   After login (E1), they go to S2 (Logged In).
   They can add an item (E2) → moves to S3 (Item Added to Cart).
   When they place the order (E3), they reach S4 (Order Placed).
   Logout (E4) always takes them back to S1 (Not Logged In)
